<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I just want you to know that no matter what anyone says, you will always be our first
  dad. Hide your diamonds, hide your exes, I’m a little bit Alexis! Oh, I’d kill for a
  good coma right now. Like Beyoncé, I excel as a solo artist. If you’re looking for an
  ass to kiss, it’s mine. This place is almost charming. Very rustic cottage… I was half
  expecting early Unabomber.</p>

<p>OK, yeah, no, I did not write this… OK, like, I didn’t even choose this font! It’s
  horrible. What kind of barnyard were you raised in? I don’t want to brag, but Us Weekly
  once described me as ‘up for anything.' The idea of me life coaching another human
  being should scare you… a lot. I totally get that. We just need a body. Then go to the
  morgue.</p>

<p>Well, this town is very screamnastic. Very uninterested in that opinion. I was
  casually seeing Prince Harry, so there was the whole, like, ‘Is she gonna be a
  princess’ thing… um, but it’s also because we were going through this very dark
  phase where we were just, like, partying too hard. Never let the bastards get you
  down! You’d think there’d be more of a market for oversized paintings of other people’s
  families.</p>
